Experimental Operating System (XOS)
===================================
Version 1.0.1
--------------
Created a virtual operating System on simulated machine Hardware to understand how the resources of the system are managed i.e., process management, memory management(Virtualisation using Demand- Paging) and some other basic features for working of an OS.
Implemented Schedulers for multiprogramming, file management algorithms, process System Calls, exception handler and Demand paging algorithm.
--------------------
This is a platform for building a simple operating system upon a simulated machine hardware. Various components have been provided in this development package.

Components
==========
APL-Compiler
SPL-Compiler
XFS-Interface
XSM


Compiling
=========
* Use 'make' from the base directory to compile all components

* To compile each component separately, cd into the corresponding directory
and use 'make' command.

* To recompile each component, within the corresponding directory, first use 'make clean' and then use 'make' command.
